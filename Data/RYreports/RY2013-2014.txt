22Welcome to the Retail Year in Review, a detailed analysis of 
wine and spirits sales at Fine Wine & Good Spirits stores in 
Pennsylvania. We create this publication annually to provide 
more insight into sales trends of both wines and spirits statewide 
and in various regions of the commonwealth. 
In 2013–14, the PLCB experienced another record-setting sales 
year. While wine and spirits sales are nearly evenly split based on 
units sold, wine continues to increase its market share in terms 
of dollars spent. The No. 1 brand based on units sold was Barefoot 
Wine, sales of which grew by 27 percent in the 2013–14 retail year. 
Wine sales are increasing, but spirits still make up the majority 
of dollar sales in Fine Wine & Good Spirits stores. Fireball Whiskey 
continued its incredible rise, growing by more than 200 percent 
in both units sold and dollar sales. Approximately 55 percent 
of those sales were to licensees. In addition, vodkas marketed

growth in Pennsylvania. 
As an agency, the PLCB continues to focus on rebranding Fine 
Wine & Good Spirits stores, making them more accessible and 
consumer-friendly. The rebranding initiative has positively 
increased sales in new stores and contributed to sales increases 
in certain counties. For instance, Allegheny County showed 
a 4.29 percent growth in dollar sales year over year. Delaware

Several calculations were performed on the data. These include percentage change, percentage 
share, average price and dollars per transaction. Percentage change compares total sales from 
year to year. Percentage share is the amount an item or county is of the whole group. Average 
price is determined by dividing dollar sales by units sold. The average price will not match 
the listed shelf price because it includes sales to licensees and promotional sales. Dollars per 
transaction is calculated by dividing the dollar sales of a store by the number of transactions. 
No additional calculations were performed on the dollar sales amount. Therefore, these totals 
include the standard markup and the liquor tax. Sales tax (6%) or any local taxes, such as those 
for Allegheny and Philadelphia counties, are not applied.

Retail year sales and shares provide an overview of the yearly sales as well as the portions of sales 
by department, category, month and day. Sales for the current retail year were up 2.84 percent 
to $2,018,998,231.51. The past eight years of sales are presented in Figure 1. The results do not
